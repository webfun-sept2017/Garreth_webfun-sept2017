					No one has yet come up with a logical explanation, but lately in MLB there seems to be an unusually high number of players who bear a striking resemblance to actor Aaron Paul. Paul - who starred as Jessie Pinkman in the drama series Breaking Bad and, more recently, as Todd Chavez in the animated comedy Bojack Horseman - is known for his non-traditionally-handsome looks, his soulfully piercing blue eyes, and his ever-present stubble.
					<br>
					<br>
					It seems that almost every MLB team has at least one Paul lookalike, while some have two or three. (Could this be related to this year's extraordinary spike in home runs?? Who knows!) There are too many players to focus on here, but such players include: 
					<ul> 
						<li>Lonnie Chisenhall (OF, Cleveland)</li>
						<li>Kris Bryant (3B, Chicaco Cubs)</li>
						<li>Wil Myers (1B, San Diego)</li>
						<li>Cory Spangenburg (2B, San Diego)</li>
					</ul>
					Below, I present a table to help keep track of these players, along with a system for categorizing just how Aaron Paul-ish they look. I give one point for each Paul-like characteristic (blue eyes, stubble, handsomeness) and we'll see who wins!

				Well this has settled nothing. We seem to have a two way tie!
